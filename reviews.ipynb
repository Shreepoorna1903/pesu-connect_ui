        "# Predicting Sentiment Labels\n",
        "\n",
        "In this experiment, you will explore the accuracy of sentiment classificaiton using different feature representations of text documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, you will implement `createBasicFeatures`, which creates a sparse matrix representation of a collection of documents.  As we discussed in class, many classification models represent a document as a sparse vector of of features and their weights. Weights could be boolean, counts, tf-idf values, or other functions of the document. In a linear model, we then combine the document vectors with the candidate output classes and learn weights for each of the feature-class pairs. This last step is implemented for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this exercise, you should have a feature for each word containing at least one alphabetic character. You may use the `numpy` and `sklearn` packages to help with implementing a sparse matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, you will implement `createFancyFeatures`, which can specify at any other features you choose to help improve performance on the classification task.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two code blocks at the end train and evaluate two models—logistic regression with L1 and L2 regularization—using your featurization functions. Besides held-out classification accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation, you will also see the features in each class given high weights by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many helpful resources online for getting up to speed with vector representations of documents. One example is the first two chapters of Delip Rao and Brian McMahan, _Natural Language Processing with PyTorch_, O'Reilly, 2019.
